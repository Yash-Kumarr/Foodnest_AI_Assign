# Foodnest_AI_Assign
The task involved designing a Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm to optimize food delivery rider assignments and routing in Lucknow, minimizing idle time, travel distances, and ensuring on-time deliveries within capacity constraints.
Code Summary
Synthetic Data: Generated mock data for orders (locations, weights) and riders (capacities, idle times).
Environment (LogisticsEnv): Custom gym environment with states (rider/order data), actions (assignments), and rewards (penalizing idle time, distance).
Q-Learning Agent: Trains RL to dynamically allocate orders to riders, optimizing assignments over episodes.
Visualization: Plots rider routes, pickups, and drop-offs before and after training.
Performance: Tracks travel distances, fuel costs, and rewards to validate efficiency improvements.
Key Outcome
This project demonstrates expertise in RL, data preprocessing, and optimization, delivering a scalable logistics solution with measurable performance improvements.
